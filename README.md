# Jellysser for webOS

This is a small unofficial wrapper around the web interface that the server provides [(https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web)](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr) so most of the developement happens there.

## Development

The general development workflow looks like this:

-   Prepare a build environment of your choice (see below)
-   Compile an IPK either with the IDE or with ares-package
-   Test the app on the emulator or ares-server or install it on your tv by following http://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/

There are three ways of creating the required build environment:

-   Full WebOS SDK Installation
-   Docker
-   NPM ares-cli

### Full WebOS SDK Installation

-   Install the WebOS SDK from http://webostv.developer.lge.com/sdk/installation/

### Docker

A prebuilt docker image is available that includes the build and deployment dependencies, see [Docker Hub](https://ghcr.io/oddstr13/docker-tizen-webos-sdk).

### Managing the ares-tools via npm

This requires `npm`, the Node.js package manager.

Execute the following to install the required WebOS toolkit for building & deployment:

`npm install`

Now you can package the app by running

`npm run package`

## Building with Docker or WebOS SDK

`dev.sh` is a wrapper around the Docker commands, if you have installed the SDK directly, just ommit that part.

```sh
# Build the package via Docker
./dev.sh ares-package --no-minify services frontend
# Build the package with natively installed WebOS SDK
ares-package --no-minify services frontend
```

## Usage

Fill in your hostname, port and schema and click connect. The app will check for a server by grabbing the manifest and the public serverinfo.
And then the app hands off control to the hosted webUI.

## Testing

Testing on a TV requires [registering a LG developer account](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/preparing-account/) and [setting up the devmode app](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/using-devmode-app/).

Once you have installed the devmode app on your target TV and logged in with your LG developer account, you need to turn on the `Dev Mode Status` and `Key Server`.
**Make sure** to take a note of the passphrase.

```sh
# Add your TV. The defaults are fine, but I recommend naming it `tv`.
./dev.sh ares-setup-device --search

# This command sets up the SSH key for the device `tv` (Key Server must be running)
./dev.sh ares-novacom --device tv --getkey

# Run this command to verify that things are working.
./dev.sh ares-device-info -d tv

# This command installs the app. Remember to build it first.
./dev.sh ares-install -d tv org.lrwm3.webos.jellyseer_*.ipk

# Launch the app and the web developer console.
./dev.sh ares-inspect -d tv org.lrwm3.webos.jellyseer

# Or just launch the app.
./dev.sh ares-launch -d tv org.lrwm3.webos.jellyseer
```
